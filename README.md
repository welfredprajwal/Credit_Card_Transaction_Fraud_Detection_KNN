# Credit_Card_Transaction_Fraud_Detection_KNN
Credit card fraud detection using the KNN algorithm identifies fraudulent transactions by analyzing spending patterns. The model classifies transactions based on similarity to past data. It detects anomalies efficiently, improving security. Accuracy is evaluated using a confusion matrix, ensuring reliable fraud detection with minimal false.(KNN works by finding k training examples closest to a given input and then predicts the class or value based on the majority class or average value of these neighbors. The performance of KNN can be influenced by the choice of k and the distance metric used to measure proximity.)
